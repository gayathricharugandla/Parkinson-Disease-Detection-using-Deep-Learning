# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is responsible for the deterioration of motor function due to loss of dopamine-producing brain cells i.e. neurons. Tremors, stiffness, slowness in movements, shaking, and 
impaired balance are some of the primary symptoms of PD. In this project we are using various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, XGBOOST and MLP (multilayer perceptron) to predict Parkinson disease from SPEECH 
file but this algorithms prediction accuracy is not accurate so we are implementing advance Convolution Neural Network (CNN2D) and then compare its performance with machine learning algorithms.
The model is trained with the features extracted from several voice notes i.e WAV file
